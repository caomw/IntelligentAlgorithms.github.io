Intelligent Algorithms
==========

What are intelligent algorithms? How do they work? Or even what should we understand in *machine learning*. The buzzword *big data* is well known. But what are the algorithm behind them.

Motivation
-----------

To recap the basic I want to explain and illustrate them, since if you not able to illustrate algorithms or methods you don't understand them. Impressed by the [beautiful illustrations of Mike Bostock][mike] I will try to learn how to create good looking *d3.js* figures for most of the topics in machine learning.
