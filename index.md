Intelligent Algorithms
==========

What are intelligent algorithms? How do they work? Or even what should we understand in *machine learning*. The buzzword *big data* is well known. But what are the algorithm behind them.

Motivation
-----------

To recap the basic I want to explain and illustrate them, since if you not able to illustrate algorithms or methods you don't understand them. Impressed by the [beautiful illustrations of Mike Bostock][mike] my wish is to learn how to create such stunning *d3.js* figures for most of the topics in machine learning. This looks like TikZ at the next level. You should definetely checkout his [beautiful works][mike].
This is a good opportunity for me to

- learn and practise D3.js
- make the representation more beautiful with carefully chosen fonts and alignments
- to recap all basic theory about machine learning
- learn Julia as a new programming language

At least this kind of presenting information has a huge advantage compared to traditional books. First, I can use all colors that can be represented by $$3\cdot 32$$ bytes. Second, this way enabled to let the user interact with the illustration in contrast to just to look at them. Feel free to play around with them. And third, using `git` makes it easy to remove typing errors or other mistakes.
