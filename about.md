What are intelligent algorithms? What is *machine learning*? The buzzword *big data* is ubiquitous. 
This should be a small project writing about basic regression, SVM, neural networks, reinforcement learning, MCTS for AI in games.

This little project is just to recap the basic, summarize methods and practise my english. Last but not least, it a good exercise for learning the Julia-language (which can be sometimes more tricky than JavaScript). It is a kind of challenge writing this stuff in JavaScript or small examples. Impressed by the [beautiful illustrations of Mike Bostock][mike] I started to play around and animate some graph. Sometimes it is time consuming writing this stuff. But in the end, if the figure works like I expected, I often get impressed how handy a web-browser can be.

The slogan is: *If you not able to sketch illustrations of algorithms or methods you don't actually understand them!*

D3.js seems to be like the next generation of TikZ in some way. You should definitely checkout the [beautiful works][mike] of Mike Bostock.
This way of presenting information has a huge advantage compared to traditional books, namely:

1. I can use all colors that can be represented by $$32^3$$ bytes. No consideration of toner.
2. Adding one additional phrase does not screw up a page limit, or prey on my conscience about the enviroment.
3. Allowing user interaction at the figures motivates to play around with some values. So, feel free to play around with them.
4. Using `git` makes it easy to remove typing errors or other mistakes.

Planned Stuff
--------------

At least some buzzwords from my todo-list

- Quasi-Newton-Algorithms like BFGS, L-BFGS, L-BFGS-B
- SVM, structSVM
- Random-Forrest
- Nearest Neighbors
- neural networks (and convolutional neural networks)
- PCA, t-SNE
- unsupervised algorithms: LDA, k-means, GMM
- graphical Models, CRF, HMM
