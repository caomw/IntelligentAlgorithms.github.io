Intelligent Algorithms
==========

What are intelligent algorithms? How do they work? Or even what should we understand in *machine learning*. The buzzword *big data* is well known. This should be a small project writing about basic regression, SVM, neural networks, reinforcement learning, MCTS in game AI.

Motivation
-----------
This project is intended to recap the basics for myself and practise writing in english. My opinion abou understanding is that: If you not able to illustrate algorithms or methods you don't actually understand them. Impressed by the [beautiful illustrations of Mike Bostock][mike] I started to play around to animate some graph is to learn how to create such stunning *d3.js* figures for some of the topics in machine learning. D3.js seems to be like the next generation of TikZ in some way. You should definetely checkout the [beautiful works][mike] of Mike Bostock.
This is a good opportunity for me to

- learn and practise D3.js
- make the representation more beautiful with carefully chosen fonts and alignments
- to recap all basic theory about machine learning
- learn Julia as a new programming language

At least this kind of presenting information has a huge advantage compared to traditional books. 

1. I can use all colors that can be represented by $$32^3$$ bytes.
2. This way enabled to let the user interact with the illustration in contrast to just to look at them. Feel free to play around with them.
3. Using `git` makes it easy to remove typing errors or other mistakes.

Planned Stuff
--------------

At least some buzzwords from my todo-list

- SVM, structSVM
- RandomForrest
- Nearest Neighbors
- Newton descent and Quasi-Newton-Algorithms like BFGS
- neural networks (and convolutional neural networks)
- PCA, t-SNE
- unsupervised algorithms: LDA, k-means, GMM
- graphical Models, CRF, HMM
